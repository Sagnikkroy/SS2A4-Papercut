#  SS2A4-Papercut

A utility to combine multiple screenshots into a single, well-formatted A4 PDF. It features a GUI for selecting files, arranging their order, and automatically handles pagination and scaling.
I use this for my University labs but I think this is an useful tool and can be used for many purposes so I put it here.

##  Features
* **Visual Arranger:** Add, remove, and reorder screenshots using "Move Up/Down" buttons.
* **Smart Layout:** Automatically scales images to fit A4 width while maintaining aspect ratio.
* **Pro Spacing:** Includes side margins and vertical gaps for a clean, non-cluttered look.
* **Auto-Pagination:** Detects when a page is full and automatically creates subsequent pages.
* **High Resolution:** Renders at 300 DPI for crisp, print-ready documents.
